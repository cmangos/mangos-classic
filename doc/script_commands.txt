## Buddy concept
-- --------------------------

Commands except the ones requiring a player (like KILL_CREDIT) have support for the buddy concept.
This means that if an entry for buddy_entry is provided,
aside from source and target as listed above also a "buddy" is available.

Which one on the three (originalSource, originalTarget, buddy) will be used in the command, depends on the data_flags
Note that some commands (like EMOTE) use only the resulting source for an action.

Possible combinations of the flags
    SCRIPT_FLAG_BUDDY_AS_TARGET             = 0x01
    SCRIPT_FLAG_REVERSE_DIRECTION           = 0x02
    SCRIPT_FLAG_SOURCE_TARGETS_SELF         = 0x04
are:
0: originalSource / buddyIfProvided  ->  originalTarget
1: originalSource  ->  buddy
2: originalTarget  ->  originalSource / buddyIfProvided
3: buddy  ->  originalSource
4: originalSource / buddyIfProvided  ->  originalSource / buddyIfProvided
5: originalSource  ->  originalSource
6: originalTarget  ->  originalTarget
7: buddy  ->  buddy
Where "A  ->  B" means that the command is executed from A with B as target.

Defining a buddy could be done in several way:
    default                                         (take the buddy by entry)
    SCRIPT_FLAG_BUDDY_BY_GUID               = 0x10  (take the buddy by guid)
    SCRIPT_FLAG_BUDDY_IS_PET                = 0x20  (buddy is a pet)
    SCRIPT_FLAG_BUDDY_IS_DESPAWNED          = 0x40  (buddy is dead or despawned)
    SCRIPT_FLAG_BUDDY_BY_POOL               = 0x80  (buddy should be part of a pool)

## Each command has different parameters, and are as follows:
