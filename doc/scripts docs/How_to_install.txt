Installation Instructions
=========================

Clean install of ScriptDev2 (for Classic)
-----------------------------------------

Download C-MaNGOS (using git clone)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See their http://www.ru-mangos.ru/[forum] or https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-classic/wiki[wiki] for more details

Get the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone ScriptDev2 `git clone git://github.com/scriptdev2/scriptdev2-classic.git ScriptDev2` - execute from within src/bindings directory

*MS Windows:* +
Compile ScriptDev2 using the scriptVC80, scriptVC90 or scriptVC100 Solution within the ScriptDev2 folder (this will overwrite the Mangoscript dll in the output directory)

*GNU/Linux or CMake:* +
When running CMake on MaNGOS, make sure to set `-D INCLUDE_BINDINGS_DIR=ScriptDev2`
Compile MaNGOS (ScriptDev2 will automatically be built when compiling Mangos from here on)


Handle the databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create ScriptDev2-Database::
Execute `sql\scriptdev2_create_database.sql` , then execute +
`sql\scriptdev2_create_structure.sql` on that database.
Add content to ScriptDev2-Database::
Execute `sql\scriptdev2_script_full.sql` on scriptdev2 databse
Update ScriptNames::
Execute `sql\mangos_scriptname_full.sql` on your MaNGOS world Database

Configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Place the included "scriptdev2.conf" file within the directory containing your "mangosd.conf" and "realmd.conf" files.

You may need to change this file to match the database you created and any custom settings you wish to use.

Note this file will be differently created for Unix based systems.

Run mangosd
~~~~~~~~~~~

Run mangosd from your output directory. If you use another directory to run mangos, you need (on windows) copy the mangosscript.dll to that directory before starting mangosd.


How to Update ScriptDev2
------------------------

. Enter src/bindings/ScriptDev2 directory (with git-bash)
. Update ScriptDev2 with `git pull`
. Compile ScriptDev2 +
  On _windows_ you must still compile MaNGOS before ScriptDev2
. Update your Database with new Scriptdev2 SQL changes. For this you can either:
  * apply only the changes that were made during that revision by looking in the sql\update folder or (files named rXXX_scriptdev2.sql should be executed on the scriptdev2 db while rXXX_mangos.sql should be executed on your mangos db)
  * reapply "mangos_scriptname_full.sql" to your MaNGOS database. - WARNING this will NOT include removed script names!
