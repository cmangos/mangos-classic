When updating the playerbot.conf version, keep in mind the following locations (YYYYMMDDVV = Year, Month, Day, Version (version starting at 01, counting up as releases happen on the same day)):
* src/game/PlayerBot/config.h
define PLAYERBOT_CONF_VERSION    YYYYMMDDVV
* src/game/PlayerBot/config.h.in
define PLAYERBOT_CONF_VERSION    YYYYMMDDVV
* src/game/PlayerBot/playerbot.conf.dist.in
ConfVersion=YYYYMMDDVV
* Of course don't forget to update your server's playerbot.conf.

When updating the sql file(s), keep in mind the following:

=== File Name Description in [sql/PlayerBot] folder ===

    FULL_playerbotai_characters_r2_update
    |    |           |          |  |
    |    |           |          |  Only if the sql updates a previous sql
    |    |           |          |
    |    |           |          Playerbot revision related to sql

    For clean install, just apply this sql
