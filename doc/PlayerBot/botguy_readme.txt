BotGuy NPC Menu System
======================

What it is:
===========

The new revised'botguy' utilizes NPCs already distributed throughout the world, to allow players to
summon and dismiss bots at will, from their own account.

This is a revised (more stable) version that utilizes the new 'GOSSIP MENU SYSTEM' to modify the menus of existing NPCs
(e.g Trainers etc) to include the bot Recruit/Dismiss menu. (No GameMaster account necessary).

Install (Server administrators only)
=======
Please apply 'mangos_botguy.sql' once to the world database to update the 'gossip_menu_option' table.
