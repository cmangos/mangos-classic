Warning: New feature - do not go blindly converting to it as of 10.11.2021

Meant to emulate official server tool image logic. Ties into not just AI but also Charms and Possess for giving spells and cooldowns.
Set ID is changeable in EAI and C++ for now. Default is in creature_template SpellList column.
Logically a consolidation of EAI timer 0 event, 9 event for combat spells, creature_template_spells and creature_cooldowns tables. Meant to replace non-conditional
timers in CombatAI and is hot-reloadable.

Table creature_spell_list_entry:
Id - Spell List ID - recommended either entry or entry * 100 + 01 if entry has multiple
Name - Mandatory - Spell name with zone prefix. Example: Westfall - Defias Pillager. This naming enables querying npcs by zone, very useful in dungeons.
ChanceSupportAction and ChanceRangedAttack - Chance at each spell list tick in combat (1200ms) for the action with SPELL_LIST_FLAG_SUPPORT_ACTION (1) or
SPELL_LIST_FLAG_RANGED_ACTION (2) set respectively. If multiple are set, always one spell is selected. During melee mode, ranged attack chance is -50.
The 1200ms loop has been checked on official servers and will intentionally make the AI less responsive and less impactful on performance. EAI has a 500ms tick rate on timers,
however that is not an issue due to it needing a finer control. A normal spell list entry should never have more than 10 spells, since that was an official limitation.

Tabke creature_spell_targeting:
Id - Spell Targeting ID - Ids below 100 are reserved for future use with hardcoded targets.
Type - Hardcoded/Attack/Support - Hardcoded dont need additional parameters
Comments - Description of target in format: Type - Use.

Attack:
Param1 - enum AttackingTarget
Param2 - Number of positions from the top of the threat list to be skipped.
Param3 - enum SelectFlags

Support:
Param1 - Minimum missing health
Param2 - 0 or 1, 0 if minimum missing is flat health and 1 if minimum missing is percentage.
Param3 - 0 or 1, 0 if self should not be eligible.

Table creature_spell_list:
Id - Spell List ID
Position - Position on spell list bar - needed for Charms and Possess
SpellId - Spell ID that will be casted when this spell list is eligible
Flags - SPELL_LIST_FLAG_SUPPORT_ACTION (1) SPELL_LIST_FLAG_RANGED_ACTION (2)
TargetId - creature_spell_targeting ID
ScriptId - dbscripts_on_relay ID launched at successful cast start.
Availability - Chance for spell to be included in spell list at assignment. Assignment happens by default on spawn.
Probability - If several spells are eligible in the same spell list tick, this is the weight with which its likely this spell will go off. Higher probability,
higher chance for spell to go off.
InitialMin, InitialMax, RepeatMin, RepeatMax - Timers used for casting spell. Will emplace a cooldown on the user unlike EAI which only starts a timer. Repeat timers are used
during charm to give spells cooldowns as well.
Comments - Description of spell use - Preferred format: NPC name - <phase ID if needed> - Spell use on who

Hardcoded targets:
0 - None - nullptr
1 - Current aggro target - getVictim in c++
2 - Self
3 - Eligible friendly dispel - automatically detects eligible spells for dispel from spell id
4 - Eligible friendly dispel excluding self - same as 3
