## Syntax of this helper
## 1st param must be "maps" to generate the maps and offmesh or "offmesh" to recreate the special tiles from the OFFMESH_FILE
## 2nd param may be an additional filename for storing log
## 3rd param may be an addition filename for storing detailed log
## 4th param may be a number of threads to use for maps processing

PREFIX="$(dirname $0)"

## Additional Parameters to be forwarded to MoveMapGen, see mmaps/readme for instructions
PARAMS="--silent --configInputPath config.json"

## Offmesh file
OFFMESH_FILE="offmesh.txt"

## Normal log file (if not overwritten by second param
LOG_FILE="MoveMapGen.log"
## Detailed log file
DETAIL_LOG_FILE="MoveMapGen_detailed.log"
