# Movement based heuristics, run server-side
#
# Thresholds and actions for server-side movement based heuristics
#
# For this section, there are 23 different checks.  Each check has four values:
#
#   Tick count   - how many times must this cheat be detected in one tick of the anticheat
#   Tick action  - when the tick count is surpassed, what actions are taken
#   Total count  - how many times must this cheat be detected in one session of the anticheat
#   Total action - when the total count is surpassed, what actions are taken
#
#   Actions are a mask of the following flags, in decimal form:
#
#       CHEAT_ACTION_NONE           = 0x00,
#
#       informational notification (no actions are suggested)
#       CHEAT_ACTION_INFO_LOG       = 0x01,
#
#       prompting notification (suggested actions defined by other flags)
#       CHEAT_ACTION_PROMPT_LOG     = 0x02,
#
#       disconnect the offending world session
#       CHEAT_ACTION_KICK           = 0x04,
#
#       permanently ban the offending account
#       CHEAT_ACTION_BAN_ACCOUNT    = 0x08,
#
#       permanently ban the offending ip address
#       CHEAT_ACTION_BAN_IP         = 0x10,
#
#       permanently silences the offending account
#       CHEAT_ACTION_SILENCE        = 0x20,
#
#    Movement.BadFallReset.Enable
#        Description: Check for wrong data in fall reset opcode.
#        Default:     1 - (Enabled)
#                     0 - (Disabled)
#
#    Movement.BadFallReset.Threshold
#        Description: Detections needed to trigger a penalty.
#        Default:     1
#
#    Movement.BadFallReset.Penalty
#        Description: Action to take upon failing this check.
#        Default:     11 - Log, Report to GM, Kick
#
#   Examples:
#       * To ban the account and IP, the mask is 0x08 | 0x10, or 0x18, or 24.
#       * To send out a notification, prompting for an action of an account ban
#         or silence, the mask is 0x02 | 0x08 | 0x20, or 0x2A, or 42.
#
#   If the tick count is zero, the tick action will never be performed.  Similarly,
#   if the total count is zero, the total action will never be performed.
