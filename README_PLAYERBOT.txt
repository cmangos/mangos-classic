What it is:
===========

Playerbot lets you add another character from your account as a bot that you can control and which will hopefully help you. Only characters from your account can be used, so you can have a maximum of 9 bots at one time.

This was taken from the Trinity site, and modified slightly by Blueboy to get some of the kinks out.

Bots will only use abilities that they have - for example, a priest will only use the renew spell if it has been trained. Also, bot's equipment will lose durability like any other character.

All help is welcome be it through code development, reports from play testing or just discussion. Meet us in the C-MaNGOS forum thread.
