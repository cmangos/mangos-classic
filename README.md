## Welcome to C(ontinued)-MaNGOS

CMaNGOS is a free project with the following goal:

  **Doing WoW-Emulation Right!**

This means, we want to focus on:

* WoW-Emulation
    This project is about developing a server software that is able to
    emulate a well known MMORPG service.

* Doing
  * This project is focused on developing content!
  * Also there are many other aspects that need to be done and are
    considered equally important.
  * Anyone who wants to do stuff is very welcome to do so!

* Right
  * Our goal must always be to provide the best code that we can.
  * Being 'right' is defined by the behavior of the system
    we want to emulate.
  * Developing things right also includes documenting and discussing
    _how_ to do things better, hence...
  * Learning and teaching are very important in our view, and must
    always be a part of what we do.

To be able to accomplish these goals, we support and promote:

* Freedom
  * of our work: Our work - including our code - is released under the GPL.
    So everybody is free to use and contribute to this open source project.
  * for our developers and contributors on things that interest them.
    No one here is telling anybody _what_ to do.
    If you want somebody to do something for you, pay them,
    but we are here to enjoy.
  * to have FUN with developing.

* A friendly environment
  * We try to leave personal issues behind us.
  * We only argue about content, and not about thin air!
  * We follow the [Netiquette](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855).

-- The C(ontinued)-MaNGOS Team!
